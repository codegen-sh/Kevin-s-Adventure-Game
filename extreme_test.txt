EXTREME OUT-OF-SYNC TEST FILE 🔥

This file is created in the most chaotic state possible:
- We're several commits behind main
- We have unstaged changes
- Git is complaining about conflicts
- We're trying to commit Unicode: àáâãäåæç ∑∏∆∇∂∫√∞≠≤≥±×÷
- And emoji: 🔧🐛🔍🚀🎉✨🌍🌈💻🎯🔥⚡
- Mixed content: Hello 世界 🌍 café naïve résumé ∑∏∆

Repeated Unicode patterns to stress test:
àáâãäåæç àáâãäåæç àáâãäåæç àáâãäåæç àáâãäåæç
∑∏∆∇∂∫√∞≠≤≥±×÷ ∑∏∆∇∂∫√∞≠≤≥±×÷ ∑∏∆∇∂∫√∞≠≤≥±×÷

If this doesn't trigger the garbling bug, nothing will! 💥
