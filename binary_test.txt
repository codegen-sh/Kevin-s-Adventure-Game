BINARY-LIKE TEST FILE FOR BASE64 DEBUGGING

This file contains content that might break base64 encoding:

Raw control characters:
Binary-like: ÿþýüûúùø÷öõôóòñðïîíìëêéèçæåäãâáà
High ASCII: €‚ƒ„…†‡ˆ‰Š‹ŒŽ''""•–—˜™š›œžŸ
Mixed line endings:
Unix: 
Windows: 
Mac: 

Null bytes and control chars (simulated):
[NULL][SOH][STX][ETX][EOT][ENQ][ACK][BEL][BS][HT][LF][VT][FF][CR][SO][SI]

Base64 problematic chars:
+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=+/=

JSON-breaking content:
{"test": "value with \"nested quotes\" and 
newlines and \ttabs"}

Shell-breaking content:
$HOME `echo dangerous` $(rm -rf /) && echo "pwned"

Regex nightmare:
.*+?^${}()|[]\.*+?^${}()|[]\.*+?^${}()|[]\

Backslash hell:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Mixed encoding issues:
UTF-8: café naïve résumé
Latin-1: àáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõö÷øùúûüýþÿ
Windows-1252: ""''–—…†‡•‰‹›ŒŽ

This should stress test the base64 encoding process!
