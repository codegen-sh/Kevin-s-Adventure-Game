# Game Content Creation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to create new content for Kevin's Adventure Game, including locations, items, events, NPCs, and storylines. Content creation is designed to be accessible to both programmers and non-programmers.

## Content Types

### 1. Locations
- Physical places players can visit
- Each location has descriptions, connections, items, and events
- Examples: Forest, Cave, Village, Mountain

### 2. Items
- Objects players can collect and use
- Categories: tools, weapons, consumables, treasures, quest items
- Each item has descriptions and usage effects

### 3. Events
- Random or triggered occurrences
- Can affect player stats, inventory, or world state
- Examples: finding treasure, meeting NPCs, weather changes

### 4. NPCs (Non-Player Characters)
- Characters players can interact with
- Can provide quests, trade items, or give information
- Have personalities, dialogue, and behaviors

### 5. Quests and Storylines
- Multi-step objectives for players
- Can span multiple locations and involve various NPCs
- Provide structure and goals for gameplay

## Creating New Locations

### Location Structure

Every location needs:
1. **Name**: Unique identifier
2. **Description**: Atmospheric text describing the place
3. **Connections**: List of accessible locations
4. **Items**: Objects available to pick up
5. **Events**: Special occurrences that can happen
6. **Properties**: Special characteristics (safe zone, weather effects, etc.)

### Location Template

```python
def explore_[location_name](player, world):
    """Handle [location] exploration events and interactions."""
    print("\nYou enter the [location description]...")
    
    # Random events based on probability
    event_chance = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    if event_chance <= 25:
        _[location]_event_1(player)
    elif event_chance <= 50:
        _[location]_event_2(player, world)
    # ... more events
    
    # Update world state
    update_world_state(world, "[location]_visited", True)
    
    return True

def get_[location]_description():
    """Get detailed description of the [location]."""
    return "A detailed description of this location..."

def get_[location]_items():
    """Get list of items available in [location]."""
    return ["item1", "item2", "item3"]

def get_[location]_connections():
    """Get list of connected locations."""
    return ["Location1", "Location2"]
```

## Creating New Items

### Item Categories

1. **Consumables**: Used once and disappear
   - Food items (restore health)
   - Potions (various effects)
   - Scrolls (one-time magic effects)

2. **Tools**: Provide functionality
   - Map (shows locations)
   - Torch (provides light)
   - Pickaxe (mining capability)

3. **Weapons**: Combat and defense
   - Sword (increased damage)
   - Shield (damage reduction)
   - Bow (ranged attacks)

4. **Treasures**: Valuable items
   - Gems (sell for gold)
   - Artifacts (quest items)
   - Coins (currency)

### Item Template

```python
# Add to game/items.py

# Item descriptions
item_descriptions["new_item"] = "Description of the new item and its properties."

# Item usage function
def use_new_item(player, world):
    """Handle new item usage."""
    if "new_item" not in player["inventory"]:
        print("You don't have this item.")
        return False
    
    # Item effect logic here
    print("You use the new item...")
    
    # Remove item if consumable
    if item_is_consumable:
        player["inventory"].remove("new_item")
    
    return True
```
