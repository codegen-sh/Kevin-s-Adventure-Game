## 🛠️ Development

### Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture:

- **`main.py`**: Entry point that orchestrates the game loop
- **`game/`**: Core game mechanics and systems
- **`locations/`**: Individual location implementations
- **`utils/`**: Shared utilities and helper functions

### Key Components

- **Player System** (`game/player.py`): Manages character creation, stats, and progression
- **World System** (`game/world.py`): Handles location management and world state
- **Item System** (`game/items.py`): Manages inventory, item interactions, and effects
- **Weather System** (`game/weather.py`): Provides dynamic environmental conditions
- **Save System** (`utils/save_load.py`): Handles game persistence

### Adding New Features

1. **New Locations**: Add modules to `locations/` directory
2. **New Items**: Extend the item system in `game/items.py`
3. **New Creatures**: Add to `game/mythical.py`
4. **New Events**: Extend `utils/random_events.py`
