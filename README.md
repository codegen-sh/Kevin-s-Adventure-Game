## Development

### Adding New Locations

1. Create a new location file in `locations/`
2. Add the location to the World class in `game/world.py`
3. Update the interaction handler in `World.interact_with_location()`

### Adding New Items

1. Define item properties in `game/items.py`
2. Add usage logic in `game/actions.py` in the `handle_use_item()` function
3. Place items in locations via the Location class

### Error Handling

The game uses custom exceptions defined in `game/exceptions.py`:
- `GameError`: Base exception for all game errors
- `PlayerError`: Player-related errors
- `LocationError`: Location-related errors
- `SaveLoadError`: Save/load operation errors

## Save System

The game automatically saves when you quit and supports loading previous saves. Save files are stored in JSON format in the `saves/` directory with backward compatibility for older save formats.
