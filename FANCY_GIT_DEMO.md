## Current Status
âœ¨ **FANCY GIT DEMO COMPLETE!** âœ¨

### Git Worktree âœ…
Created a parallel working directory at `../kevin-worktree-experiment`
This allows working on multiple branches simultaneously!

### Interactive Rebase âœ…
Demonstrated commit squashing using `git reset --soft HEAD~2`
Combined multiple commits into a single, clean commit!

### Cherry Picking âœ…
Created a separate branch and cherry-picked commits across branches
Commit `c1d94f2` was successfully cherry-picked!

### Git Hooks âœ…
Created a fancy pre-commit hook with:
- Python syntax checking
- TODO comment detection
- Automated quality checks

### Reflog Magic âœ…
Showed git reflog to track all HEAD movements
Perfect for recovering "lost" commits and understanding git history!
